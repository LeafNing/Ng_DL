# Neural Networks and Deep Learning
exercise in deep learning coursera

## week2
Building basic neural networks

## week3
Planar data classification with one hidden layer

## week4
Build a deep network, and apply it to cat vs non-cat classification. Hopefully, you will see an improvement in accuracy relative to your previous logistic regression implementation.
